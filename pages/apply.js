          Penn Labs builds products that help students navigate life at Penn. We're a team of software engineers, product designers, and business developers.
          <br/><br/> Some Penn Labs products that you may be familiar with include Penn Course Review, Penn Mobile, and Penn Clubs. We’ve had more than 100,000 total users of our products. Through the Common Funding Application we build and maintain, we've helped processed over $930,000 in grants for student organizations.
          <br/><br/> Penn Labs is a community, as well as a commitment. We meet for 4 hours each week for work, discussion, and education. Members are also expected to work outside of GBMs to meet product goals. These high expectations are in order to fulfill our mission of building tech products to serve Penn students.
